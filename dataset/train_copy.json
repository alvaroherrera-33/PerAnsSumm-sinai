Seeking professional guidance for sleeping issues, including the possibility of taking sleeping tablets or magnesium supplements, may be beneficial. Additionally, it is recommended to avoid violent TV programs before bedtime, address irritations from the day, manage heavy workloads, and pray before sleep as part of a holistic approach to improving sleep quality."
