One good piece of advice in preventing colds or the flu is to not borrow pens...always make sure you have one of your own...that way you know that you're not holding something that someone who just coughed or sneezed into their hand was just touching.As always, make sure you take in lots of vitamin C daily.  Lots of orange juice, and go with a multivatimin.  FYI, all of these things are good to practice anyway but are especially good practices to remember around flu season.\nanswer_1: Eat Healthy. soups, fruit...
