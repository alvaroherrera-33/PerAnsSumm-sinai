            "they hurt when u first get them but then u get used 2 them really  easily. sometimes u like drool or spit or something but unless u have a pallete expander u can talk normal. if u have 1 ur \"K's\" get all screwed up.",
            "Yes THEy HuRt WhEn YoU fIrSt GeT them but just for a few days...If you eat something hard and it gets stuck in them it mite hurt...and also after youy get them tightened..but they do not make it hard to talk, only retainers do that!!!",

            "I just got my braces a few days ago. They felt like they were loose for the first two days, and it was really hard to eat. I got over speaking difficulties quickly, although the inside of your mouth gets kind of scratched and torn- don't fret, it heals quickly enough. After that you get calouses, so it doesn't hurt anymore. I think the pain felt depends on how old you are when you get them, what kind of treatment you are getting, and how severe your bite is. Lately, I've forgotten I'd had them on. You get used to them.",
            "Intially they are painful...also depending on your age and the condition your teeth are in. I have had my for almost 2 1/2 years and my first year was painful. Now I forget I have them...they are coming off soon and I can't wait! I recommend Aleve, its really helpful in relieving the pain."
