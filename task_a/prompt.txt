Task Description  
You are given a question ( Q ), a set of user answers ( A ), and a set of perspective categories:  
- Information: Objective facts or explanations about the condition or procedure.  
- Cause: Insights into what causes or could worsen the issue.  
- Suggestion: Advice or recommendations to address the problem.  
- Experience: Personal stories or shared experiences related to the problem.  
- Question: Queries that seek additional clarification or recommendations.  

Your task is:  
1. Span Identification: Locate specific spans within the answers ( A ) that correspond to one of these perspectives.  
2. Classification: Assign the identified span to the correct perspective category.  

Input Example
- Question (Q): "I was just diagnosed with gallstones in my gall bladder. I really don’t want to have surgery and have been told that there are other ways to get rid of the stones. Suggestions?"
- Answers (A):  
  1. "Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol. You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats. I've had the surgery, and it really isn't a big deal. If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage."  
  2. "Have you seen a gastroenterologist? They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP. I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago, and it really helped." 
  3. "The best remedy is surgery. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn’t as bad as you think it may be."  

Output Example

Key Considerations
- Contextual understanding is crucial: Ensure that spans are precise and directly tied to the category.  
- Medical knowledge will often be necessary to interpret and classify perspectives accurately.
